#  Dedicated IoT Alarm System  
### The Power of Networking & Real-Time Action

A **network-synchronized IoT alarm system** built using **ESP32-S3**, **NTP time synchronization**, and **DFPlayer Mini audio playback**, designed for real-time, reliable, and deterministic alarm execution.

---

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **time-accurate IoT alarm platform** that uses **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** instead of local RTC modules.  
The system ensures precise scheduling and reliable alarm triggering in environments where timing accuracy is critical.

It is suitable for **industrial facilities, healthcare institutions, schools, and operational centers**.
